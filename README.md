In this paper, we firstly do the survey about market opportunity. From the survey, there are still increasing demand in fire detector. However, the majority of existing products are not programmable. People want to easily open and close the alarm and check if the battery runs up. Therefore, we build a smart IOT fire detector. Taking cost, accuracy, management, we design three layer system: Physical layer, Cloud layer and Interface layer. In physical layer, sensors collect data and sends to conduit. Then conduit encode and decode data then send data to cloud layer. In the cloud layer, we use AWS cloud service to process data them transmit it to Interface server. Users could control the sensors in interface layer. For example, user could close the alarm remotely or they could get the battery information in mobile app. From the result, the system  become more efficient and useful.
